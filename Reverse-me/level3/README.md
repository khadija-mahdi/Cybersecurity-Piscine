# Debugging a Binary with GDB

If you have a binary without source code, you can still debug it using GDB. Follow these steps:

## 1. Start GDB with the Binary
Open your terminal and start GDB with the binary:
```bash
gdb /path/to/your/binary/level1
```

## 2. Set Breakpoints
Set breakpoints at the relevant addresses directly:
```gdb
(gdb) break *0x56556235  # Break at the scanf line
(gdb) break *0x56556241  # Break at the strcmp line
```

## 3. Run the Program
Run the program:
```gdb
(gdb) run
```

## 4. Enter Input
When prompted for input, enter a value. For example:
```
Please enter key: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

## 5. Check Registers and Memory
When you hit the first breakpoint (at `0x56556235`), you won't have source-level information, but you can still examine memory and registers.

### Inspect Memory
To check the value stored at a specific offset from the base pointer (`%ebp`):
```gdb
(gdb) print (char *)($ebp - 0x6c)  # This should show your input value
```
If you get an error about no registers, you might want to check the stack pointer instead:
```gdb
(gdb) print (char *)($esp + 0x4)  # If input is at a different offset
```

### View Registers
To inspect the current state of the registers:
```gdb
(gdb) info registers
```

## 6. Continue to the Next Breakpoint
After checking the input, continue to the next breakpoint:
```gdb
(gdb) continue
```

## 7. Check the Comparison Value
When you hit the next breakpoint (at `0x56556241`), check the value being compared:
```gdb
(gdb) print (char *)($ebp - 0x7a)  # This should show the expected value
```

## Additional Tips
- **Finding Offsets**: If you are unsure about the offsets, you can inspect the stack frame:
  ```gdb
  (gdb) backtrace  # Shows the current call stack
  (gdb) frame  # Switch to the current frame for more details
  ```

- **Disassembly**: If you want to see the assembly code to understand the flow:
  ```gdb
  (gdb) disassemble  # Shows the current function's assembly code
  ```

- **Exploring More Memory**: If you want to examine more memory around an address:
  ```gdb
  (gdb) x/40x $ebp  # Examines 40 hexadecimal words from the base pointer
  ```

## Summary
Since you donâ€™t have the source code, debugging will rely heavily on inspecting memory and understanding the assembly instructions. If the binary is stripped (compiled without debugging information), you won't get meaningful function names or line numbers, but you can still analyze the execution flow based on the addresses you've identified.
